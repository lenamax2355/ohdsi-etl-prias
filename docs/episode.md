### Lesion episodes

All measurements and observations belonging to a single MRI lesion will be grouped into an episode. The following three episodes are present:
- lesion1: consists of the variables `mri_pirads_1.0`, `mri_largest_dia_1.0`, `mri_location_1.0` and `mri_location_free_1.0`
- lesion2: consists of the variables `mri_pirads_2.0`, `mri_largest_dia_2.0`, `mri_location_2.0` and `mri_location_free_2.0`
- lesion3 consists of the variables `mri_pirads_3.0`, `mri_largest_dia_3.0`, `mri_location_3.0` and `mri_location_free_3.0`

Capture an episode for each person and lesion group, except:
- When all values within the episode are 0, None or empty strings --> Do not capture episode
- When `mri_taken.0` != 1 --> Do not capture episode

The record_source_value is used to link the episode to the events (i.e. observation and measurement records) occurring in the episode.
This variable is not included in OMOP CDM v6 + oncology extensions and should be removed from the episode table after all mappings are finished.

### Core biopsy episodes

All measurements and observations belonging to core biopsies taken will be grouped into an episode. The following two episodes are present:
- core_biopsy1: consists of the variables `num_cores`, `num_cores_pc`, `gleason1` and `gleason2`
- core_biopsy2: consists of the variables `num_cores2`, `num_cores_pc2`, `gleason1_2` and `gleason2_2`

Capture an episode for each person and lesion group, except:
- When all `num_cores` is empty ('') --> Do not capture episode
- When all `num_cores2` is empty ('') --> Do not capture episode

The record_source_value is used to link the episode to the events (i.e. observation and measurement records) occurring in the episode.
This variable is not included in OMOP CDM v6 + oncology extensions and should be removed from the episode table after all mappings are finished.

### Core biopsy episodes

All measurements and observations belonging to core biopsies taken will be grouped into an episode. The following episode is present:
- core_biopsy1: consists of the variables `num_cores_biop_fu`, `num_cores_pc_fu`, `gleason1_fu` and `gleason2_fu`

Capture an episode for each person and lesion group, except:
